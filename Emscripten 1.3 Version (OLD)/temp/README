The program will work for only 20 seconds. If you want to change the time see custom.js line 24

I ran sdl1.ceu with ceu and I used main-sdl.c

The commands:
ceu sdl1.ceu
emcc main-sdl.c -o output.html -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_begin', '_update', '_async_call', '_ceu_draw']" -s NO_EXIT_RUNTIME=1 -s USE_SDL=2 --shell-file custom_shell.html --pre-js custom.js

IMPORTANT
NEEDS EMSCRIPTEN VERSION 1.3 to work(recommended using portable)

WARNING
It is highly unoptimized and will run like crap. With time it will be better

To see the result without just open output.html
