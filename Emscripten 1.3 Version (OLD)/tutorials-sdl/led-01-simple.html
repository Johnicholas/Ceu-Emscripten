Hello to the Ceu with SDL tutorial!

<p>
You should be proud of yourself for comming this far.

<p>
For the first example we are going to have a blinking led. Since this is the first example, a part of the code has been hidden so that we could focus on the important stuff. In the next tutorial we will reveal the entire code as well.

<p>
We use <code>par/or</code> to interact with the signals. One thing to note is that <code>SDL_Quit</code> will never be reached, however it is good practice to insert it anyway, especially if you want to copy and paste the code and run it on your computer and then be surprised that you can't close the app.

<p>
Every half a second we change the value of <code>is_on</code> (you can think of it as a boolean value) and since <code>SDL_Quit</code> will never be reached, this will never stop.

<p>
<code>SDL_Redraw</code> is called every time a frame is drawn so at 60FPS <code>SDL_Redraw</code> is called 60 times every second. So every frame we draw the background and a circle, then depending on the value of <code>is_on</code> a smaller circle is drawn.

<p>
<code>_boxRGBA</code> takes a Renderer(discussed in the next tutorial), the lower left coordinates(0,0), the width(_REN_W) and height(_REN_H) and four hexa values that represent the RGB and alpha.
<code>_filledCircleRGBA</code> takes a Renderer, the coordinates(200, 200) the length of the radius(50) and the RGBA values in hexa

<p>
<b>Challenge</b>
<p>
Try and make it so that the first 500ms the circle is red, the next 500ms it's yellow and the last 500ms it's green, after which it will be read again and the cycle repeats.
